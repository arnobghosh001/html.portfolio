<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Arnob, and I'm a passionate web developer with a flair for creating visually appealing and functional websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in front-end development and strive to deliver user-friendly and responsive designs. My goal is to create websites that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their device or browser. In addition to web development, I have a keen interest in graphic design and animation, which allows me to bring a unique and creative touch to my projects. When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring new places, spending time with my family and friends, or learning new skills to further enhance my capabilities as a web developer</p>
